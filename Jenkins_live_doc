Install Jenkins-> 
create a t2 micro aws intance (amazn linux 2 ami), open ports: 80, 443, 22, 8080 (for learning you can open all traffic)
** jenkins works on port 8080


https://github.com/prakashk0301/devops-june-24/blob/master/Install_jenkins



IP: internet protocol

Public IPs are dyanamic (changabel)


EIP (Elastic IP)-> static IP->chargable :
a. if not associate to any of the instance
b. associated but instance is not running.


if instance is running then no charges

How to access jenkins from local windows system

https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/

http://localhost:8080



-----------------
if jenkins is taking time to load the page then(you need to perform below activity after every reboot)


jenkins dashboard -> manage jenkins -> system -> Jenkins Location  -> provide your current public IP




-------------------
jenkins acts as build and release tool or CI/CD (cont integration and cont delivery) tool

we can create build (or project or pipeline) & release job



***install plugin ---> to enable option(to see the setting)
***install tool   ---> to run the command (ex. maven command, docker command,terraform, python etc)

--------------jenkins first job


jenkins dashboard -> new item -> select freestyle  (is compatible with any code language, it executes all
the activity sequencially)

-> under the build steps -> execute shell -> echo "hello jenkins"  -> save


build now -> build history -> 1,2 ,3 .... -> click on build number->  console output



----> you can configure the job:
job -> configure -> then you can update


-----------2nd jenkins job: how to print IP
jenkins dashboard -> new item -> select freestyle -> under the build steps -> execute shell


MYIP=$(ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{ print $7; exit }') 
echo "$MYIP"


save -> build

===========================27-7-2024
if you forgot the password then->

cd /var/lib/jenkins
ls
sudo vi config.xml

then update security(line number 7): put false instead of true


sudo service jenkins restart
or
sudo systemctl restart jenkins


then try to access jenkins dashboard


Browser: <ip>:8080
======


Let's configure Jenkins to build maven.


1. Install maven tool (build tool) in Jenkins Instance
2. Install maven plugins: 

jenkins dashboard- > manage jenkins-> manage plugin -> available

  a. pipeline maven integration
  b. maven integration

3. configure/provide maven executable path

access jenkins ec2 terminal -> once connected -> 
mvn -v
which git




jenkins dashboard- > manage jenkins->tool-> Maven installations 
ex: MAVEN_HOME
and provide executable path


JDK installations 
ex: Name - > JDK_HOME or JAVA_HOME
and provide executable path


jenkins dashboard- > manage jenkins->tool-> Git installations 
ex: Name - > Default
and provide executable path 



==========================Maven Build Tool

Maven Goal or LifeCycle Rules -> maven has 7 goals or lifecycle rules.


1. validate -> it validates the jenkins job, code structure, 
               it checks if there is any missing necessary files ex. pom.xml (it contains code dependacies)
2. compile
3. test
4. package     (most imp goal, we usually work with package)
5. install
6. verify
7. deploy




***clean the workspace directory before building the job
