How to access jenkins from local windows system

https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/

http://localhost:8080



-----------------
if jenkins is taking time to load the page then(you need to perform below activity after every reboot)


jenkins dashboard -> manage jenkins -> system -> Jenkins Location  -> provide your current public IP




-------------------
jenkins acts as build and release tool or CI/CD (cont integration and cont delivery) tool

we can create build (or project or pipeline) & release job



***install plugin ---> to enable option(to see the setting)
***install tool   ---> to run the command (ex. maven command, docker command,terraform, python etc)

--------------jenkins first job


jenkins dashboard -> new item -> select freestyle  (is compatible with any code language, it executes all
the activity sequencially)

-> under the build steps -> execute shell -> echo "hello jenkins"  -> save


build now -> build history -> 1,2 ,3 .... -> click on build number->  console output



----> you can configure the job:
job -> configure -> then you can update


-----------2nd jenkins job: how to print IP
jenkins dashboard -> new item -> select freestyle -> under the build steps -> execute shell


MYIP=$(ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{ print $7; exit }') 
echo "$MYIP"


save -> build
